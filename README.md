# Skate and die

A 48 hour "game jam" game.

It's like paperboy but there is only one paper.

It's like a regular platformer but there is only one button: jump. Also fixed jump arcs, because we hate you.

It's a regular city, but there are spikes. 

It's like super meat boy but it's less polished and you can't run. 

It's like skate or die, but you'll die. Many times.

It's like I spent way to much writing this readme and less time making the game.
